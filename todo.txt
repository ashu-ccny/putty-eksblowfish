Recipe file will run with mkfiles.pl, but the resulting makefile does not
work.  Issues:  this adds bcrypt-ruby/ to the include directories, which
causes a conflict: 
	windows.h --> wincrypt.h --> bcrypt.h

Window's own bcrypt.h gets confused with the one we have provided, causing
many errors, e.g. in ncrypt.h.

The temporary fix is to just remove bcrypt-ruby from the include directories,
and then compile bcrypt.c manually.  A working makefile can be found in
.\windows\MakefileBcrypt.vc, but at the moment, still requires that bcrypt.c,
blowfish.c, and fpurge.c be compiled manually, with the object files moved
over to the windows/ directory.

Run mkfiles.pl and then diff Makefile.vc with MakefileBcrypt.vc to see the
changes.
